what's the correct cmds for real robot data?

Format of robot data? trajectories or actions or both?

Which data includes multiple objects in environmental abstractions?

How to combine data from different long horizon tasks?

Seems ContinuousFactoredEncoderNetwork uses behavioral and environmental abstraction, it has many succeed class such as ContinuousSequentialFactoredEncoderNetwork & ContinuousFactoredSoftEncoderNetwor, what's the difference?

Policy managers, which one is the best, what's the different between the ones with "joint" and the ones without it

difference between PolicyManager_Joint & PolicyManager_Transfer & PolicyManager_Pretrain & PolicyManager_Imitation & PolicyManager_BatchPretrain.

difference between PolicyManager_DMPBaselines & PolicyManager_JointFixEmbedTransfer & PolicyManager_CycleConsistencyTransfer & PolicyManager_JointTransfer

difference between baselineRL & downstreamRL & DMP policy_managers


how to decied the number_policies

ee_trajs ???


settings below includes 2 different datasets? transfer learning? relation of source & target dataset


detail of object-state why it is 14 dim (2 objects)
robot dim is 7 ? 6joint + gripper?
demo dim is 21 sum of above items?

how 'RealWorldRigidJEEF' works,

difference between
'RealWorldRigidPreproc'
'RealWorldRigid','RealWorldRigidRobot'
'RealWorldRigidJEEF' 2objs how to extend to more objects

when normalize data should we use min max in setting or min max in dataset

training VTI doesn't need cost func?
while training the high leavel-func will it update VTI?

Dexmv running cmds

collect data, how to normalize, what we need to acount, the whole procedure

in pretrain progress, not cost or reward involved, how? imitation? how to compare to RL in SIM?

How to get the similar clustering result on the official website

get_trajectory_segment func? only one seg?

def construct_dummy_latents(self, latent_z): why not setting the last one to 1?

def set_extents(self): what are the extents???? what for??


how to use evaluate()? visualize_robot_data? get_trajectory_and_latent_sets()? visualize_embedding_space()
